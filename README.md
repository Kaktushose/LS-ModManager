## Contributing

If you think that something is missing and you want to add it yourself, feel free to open a pull request. 
I recommend to open an issue first in order to avoid misunderstandings, e.g. you start working on feature 
I'm already planning to add. Please note the following things:

* Follow the Java Conventions
* Test your code
* Your code quality should be at least as good as mine ;)
* Work object-oriented and try to avoid static
* Keep the purpose of this project in mind (easy to use and lightweight)
