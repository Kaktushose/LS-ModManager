## Installation

You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/Kaktushose/LS-ModManager/releases/latest). 

You can either execute the msi installer or just run the jar. The msi installer ships its own jre, but if you use the jar you must have at least Java 11 installed. 

*Please note: This program uses some Windows related paths and was only tested on Windows systems. However, you can still run the jar on any operating system.*
